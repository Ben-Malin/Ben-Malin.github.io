2D simulation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Makes use of adaptive mesh refinement to minimise diffusion at the interface.  

This was just an exercise to experiment with AMR, no particular scientific value, just skill sharpening  
Some time soon I'll make a proper blog post and share the code I used to make this
